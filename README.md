# neu_reddit_covid_sentiments

This project gives a general overview of how members of the NEU subreddit feel about COVID-19 and how Northeastern administration has addressed the disease in its policies. Comments extracted from the NEU subreddit are sentimentally analyzed and assigned a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment score based on the words contained within those comments. The program references lists of words made by me to decide the tone of a certain comment.
